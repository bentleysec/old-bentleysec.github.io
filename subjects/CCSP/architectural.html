            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cloud application</b> - An application that does not reside or run on a user's device but rather is accessible via a network</li>
                <li><b>Cloud application portability</b> - The ability to migrate a cloud application from one cloud provider to another</li>
                <li><b>Cloud computing</b> - Network-accessible platform that delivers services from a large and scalable pool of systems, rather than dedicated physical hardware and more static configurations</li>
                <li><b>Cloud data portability</b> - The ability to move data between cloud providers</li>
                <li><b>Cloud deployment model</b> - How cloud computing is delivered through a set of particular configurations and features of virtual resources. The cloud deployment models are public, private, hybrid , and community</li>
                <li><b>Cloud service</b> - Capabilities offered via a cloud provider and accessible via a client</li>
                <li><b>Cloud service category</b> - A group of cloud services that have a common set of features or qualities</li>
                <li><b>Community cloud</b> - A cloud services model where the tenants are limited to those that have a relationship together with shared requirements, and are maintained or controlled by at least one member of the community</li>
                <li><b>Data portability</b> - The ability to move data from one system to another without having to re-enter it</li>
                <li><b>Hybrid cloud</b> - A cloud services model that combines two other types of cloud deployment models</li>
                <li><b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b> - A cloud service category where infrastructure-level services are provided by a cloud service provider</li>
                <li><b>Measured service</b> - Cloud services are delivered and billed for in a metered way</li>
                <li><b>Multitenancy</b> - Having multiple customers and applications running within the same environment but in a way that they are isolated from each other and not visible to with other, but share the same resources</li>
                <li><b>On-demand self-service</b> - A cloud customer can provision services in an automatic manner, when needed, with minimal involvement from the cloud provider</li>
                <li><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</b>  - A cloud service category where platform services are provided to the cloud customer, and the cloud provider is responsible for the system up to the level of the actual application</li>
                <li><b>Private cloud</b> - Cloud services model where the cloud is owned and controlled by aa single entity for their own purposes</li>
                <li><b>Public cloud</b> - Cloud services model where the cloud is maintained and controlled by the cloud provider, but the services are available to any potential cloud customer</li>
                <li><b>Resource pooling</b> - The aggregation of resources allocated to cloud customers by the cloud provider</li>
                <li><b>Reversibility</b> -  The ability of a cloud customer to remove all data and applications from a cloud provider and completely remove all data from their environment</li>
                <li><b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b> - Cloud service category in which a full application is provided to the cloud customer, and the cloud provider maintains responsibility for the entire infrastructure, platform, and application</li>
                <li><b>Tenant</b> - One or more cloud customers sharing access to a pool of resources</li>
            </ul>
