            <h3>Verification against Criteria</h3>
            <h5>International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission</h5>
            <p><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/43757.html">ISO 27017</a> was built from <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/54533.html">ISO 27002</a>, adding 7 controls related to cloud services. Although, not a requirement to follow this standard in some parts of the world, following this standard can help address a wide swath of data protection and privacy standards from other nations such as GDPR. The ISO standard has a world-wide acceptance and provide a excellent framework for developing cloud services.</p>
            <h5>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</h5>
            <p><a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">PCI</a> is a requirement for organizations that want to accept cards for payment. It includes 12 requirements, but the cloud is only referenced once and refers to shared hosting requirements summarized as: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that a customerâ€™s processes can only access their data environment.</li>
                    <li>Restrict customer access and privileges to their data environment.</li>
                    <li>Enable logging and audit trails that are unique to each environment, consistent with requirement 10.</li>
                    <li>Provide processes to support forensic investigations.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>System/subsystem Product Certifications</h3>
            <h5>Common Criteria</h5>
            <p><a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/">Common Criteria</a> provides assurance that the process of specification, implementation and evaluation of a computer security product has been conducted in a rigorous and standard and repeatable manner at a level that is commensurate with the target environment for use.</p>
            <h5>FIPS 140-2</h5>
            <p>Businesses wanting to do business with the U.S. Government need to be FIPS 140-2 compliant. From <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final">NIST</a>:<blockquote>This Federal Information Processing Standard (140-2) specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a cryptographic module, providing four increasing, qualitative levels intended to cover a wide range of potential applications and environments. The areas covered, related to the secure design and implementation of a cryptographic module, include specification; ports and interfaces; roles, services, and authentication; finite state model; physical security; operational environment; cryptographic key management; electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC); self-tests; design assurance; and mitigation of other attacks.</blockquote></p>
            <p>FIPS requires that encryption, hashing, and message authentications use algorithms from an approved list.</p>
