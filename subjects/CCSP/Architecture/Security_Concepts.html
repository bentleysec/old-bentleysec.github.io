            <h3>Cryptography and Key Management</h3>
            <h5>Cryptography</h5>
            <p>NIST defines cryptography as: <blockquote>The discipline that embodies the principles, means, and methods for the transformation of data in order to hide their semantic content, prevent their unauthorized use, or prevent their undetected modification.</blockquote> Cryptography is the method by which data at rest and in motion is securely encrypted.</p>
            <h5>Key Management</h5>
            <p>NIST defines Keys as:<blockquote>A numerical value used to control cryptographic operations, such as decryption, encryption, signature generation, or signature verification. Usually a sequence of random or pseudorandom bits used initially to set up and periodically change the operations performed in cryptographic equipment for the purpose of encrypting or decrypting electronic signals, or for determining electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) patterns, or for producing other key.</blockquote></p>
            <p>Keys are essential to cryptography, properly managing the keys are critical to maintaining the security of data in the cloud. Many cloud service providers offer a key management service (KMS) to properly store and protect keys.</p>
