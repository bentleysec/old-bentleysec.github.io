                <ul>
                    <li><b><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&CK</a></b> - MITRE ATT&CKÂ® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. (Taken from the MITRE website)</li>
                    <li><b>The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis</b> - looks at the relationships and characteristics of four components: the adversary, capabilities, infrastructure, and victims.

                    <li><b>Kill chain</b> - Developed by Lockheed Martin, the kill chain is an intrusion identification and prevention model.</li>

                </ul>
                <li><h4>Threat Research</h4></li>
                <p>Threat research is keeping up with current threat trends and staying informed so that you can make informed decisions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Reputational</b> - intelligence data that has been analysed from past activities. If attacks are generated from a certain IP address, it's reputational score will decrease.</li>
                    <li><b>Behavioral</b> - examines the network behaviors for anomalies using NetFlow, protocol, and packet analysis to establish baselines and alert on outliers.</li>
                    <li><b>Indicator of compromise (IoC)</b> - any activity, artifact, or log that is associated with an attack pattern. These can include virus signatures, known malicious file hashes, domain names, IP addresses.</li>
                    <li><b>Common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)</b> - a system that ranks vulnerabilities by severity on a scale of 0 to 10:
                    <ul>
                        <li>0: no issues</li>
                        <li>0.1 - 3.9: Low</li>
                        <li>4.0 - 6.9: Medium</li>
                        <li>7.0 - 8.9: High</li>
                        <li>9.0 - 10.0: Critical</li>
                    </ul>
                    CVSS has three metric groups
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Base</b> - Characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and user environments</li>
                        <li><b>Temporal</b> - Characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time but not among user environments.</li>
                        <li><b>Environmental</b> - Characteristics of a vulnerability that are relevant and unique to a particular user's environment</li>
                    </ul>
                    The base metric groups have the following metrics:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Attack Vector (AV)</b> - how the attacker could exploit the vulnerability:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>L</b> - Local, means the attacker would need physical or logical access to the system.</li>
                            <li><b>A</b> - Adjacent, means the attacker would need to be on the local network.</li>
                            <li><b>N</b> - Network, the attacker needs to have any network access.</li>
                            <li><b>P</b> - Physical, the attacker needs physical access to the system.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li><b>Attack Complexity (AC)</b> - the difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>H</b> - High, the vulnerability requires special conditions that may be hard to find.</li>
                            <li><b>L</b> - Low, the vulnerability does not require any special conditions.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li><b>Privileges Required (PR)</b> - The authentication an attacker would need to exploit the vulnerability</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>H</b> - High, the attacker would need high level of access (administrative)</li>
                            <li><b>L</b> - Low, the attacker would need basic level of access</li>
                            <li><b>N</b> - None, the attacker would need no level of authentication.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>User Interaction (UI)</b> - the requirement for interaction with the human user of the system</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>N</b> - None, requires no user interaction.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Scope (S)</b> - If a vulnerability in on component impacts components beyond its security scope</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>U</b> - Unchanged, the vulnerability only affects resources managed by the same security authority.</li>
                            <li><b>C</b> - Changed, the vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the component.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Availability (A)</b> - If a vulnerability disrupts the service or system</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>N</b> - None, there is not availability impact.</li>
                            <li><b>L</b> - Low, system performance is degraded.</li>
                            <li><b>H</b> - High, all access to the system is down.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Confidentiality (C)</b> - Information disclosure that may occur if the vulnerability is exploited.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>N</b> - None, no confidentiality impact.</li>
                            <li><b>L</b> - Low, some access to information may occur.</li>
                            <li><b>H</b> - High, all information on the system could be compromised.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Integrity (I)</b> - Data alteration might occur.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>N</b> - None, there is no data integrity impact.</li>
                            <li><b>L</b> - Low, there may be some data alteration.</li>

                        </ul>

                </ul>
                <li><h4>Threat modeling methodologies</h4></li>
                <p>Part of the risk management process is evaluating the risk that is present in the organization. A threat modeling methodology create a framework for evaluating this risk. These are factors to consider in a threat modeling methodology:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Adversary capability</b> - Different types of attackers have different types of capabilities. Capabilities can be skill level, resources, limits, visibility, objective, and outcome.</li>
                    <li><b>Total attack surface</b> - all the points where vulnerabilities exist. These can be vulnerabilities the organization knows, or doesn't know about. It is important to develope a formalized process to look for and test vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><b>Attack vector</b> - the path or means that an attack is carried out including: phishing, malware, code injection, social engineering, exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact</b> - if an asset is compromised, how much of an impact will that have on the organization.</li>
                    <li><b>Likelihood</b> - what are the chances that a certain vulnerability on a certain asset will be compromised.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h4>Threat intelligence sharing with supported functions</h4></li>
                <p>It is important to share intelligence information with other organizations and other departments within your own organization that may be impacted.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Incident response</b> - with threat intelligence, it is important for the incident repose team members to keep up to date with the latest trends in threats and how those threats are executed.</li>
                    <li><b>Vulnerability management</b> - vulnerability information needs to be shared with everyone involved in vulnerability management.</li>
                    <li><b>Risk management</b> - a formal process that assess vulnerabilities by the likelihood and impact of a compromise, sharing this data is critical with all those involved to reduce risk.</li>
                    <li><b>Security engineering</b> - architecting security into the design of a system or set of systems, it is imperative that threat information is shared with engineers so they can design and build systems securely</li>
                    <li><b>Detection and monitoring</b> - team members that detect and monitor threats within an organization rely on timely sharing of information to identify new threats.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
