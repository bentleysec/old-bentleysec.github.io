                <li><h4>Web application scanner</h4></li>
                <p>Web application scanners focus on vulnerability discovery within web applications. These tools can work in two ways, synthetic transaction monitoring or real user monitoring. <b>Synthetic transaction monitoring</b> uses automation to test interactions with the web app and then the behavior is recorded. <b>Real user monitoring</b> analyses real user transactions while the web application is live.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</b> - OWASP ZAP (short for Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source web application security scanner. It is intended to be used by both those new to application security as well as professional penetration testers. It is one of the most active Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) projects and has been given Flagship status. When used as a proxy server it allows the user to manipulate all of the traffic that passes through it, including traffic using https. It can also run in a daemon mode which is then controlled via a REST API.</li>
                    <li><b>Burp suite</b> - Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities.Burp gives you full control, letting you combine advanced manual techniques with state-of-the-art automation, to make your work faster, more effective, and more fun.</li>
                    <li><b>Nikto</b> - Nikto is a free software command-line vulnerability scanner that scans webservers for dangerous files/CGIs, outdated server software and other problems. It performs generic and server type specific checks. It also captures and prints any cookies received. The Nikto code itself is free software, but the data files it uses to drive the program are not.</li>
                    <li><b>Arachni</b> - Arachni is a Ruby framework that is fully open-sourced. It is versatile enough to run a command line scanner, grid scanners, run Ruby library for scripted checks, and multi-user multi-scan collaboration platform.</li>

                    <li>Nessus</li>
                    <li><b>OpenVAS</b> - OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System, originally known as GNessUs) is a software framework of several services and tools offering vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management. All OpenVAS products are free software, and most components are licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Plugins for OpenVAS are written in the Nessus Attack Scripting Language, NASL. OpenVAS is an open-source alternative to commercial tools such as Nessus. OpenVAS also performs network vulnerability scans. OpenVAS is accessed through a web interface <code>https://127.0.0.1:9392.</code></li>
