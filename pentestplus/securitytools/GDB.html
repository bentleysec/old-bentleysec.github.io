            <p>GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on `inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.</p>
            <p>GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.</li>
                    <li>Make your program stop on specified conditions.</li>
                    <li>Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.</li>
                    <li>Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Those programs might be executing on the same machine as GDB (native), on another machine (remote), or on a simulator. GDB can run on most popular UNIX and Microsoft Windows variants, as well as on Mac OS X.</p>
