            <p>OWASP ZAP (short for Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source web application security scanner. It is intended to be used by both those new to application security as well as professional penetration testers.</p>
            <p>It is one of the most active Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) projects and has been given Flagship status.</p>
            <p>When used as a proxy server it allows the user to manipulate all of the traffic that passes through it, including traffic using https.</p>
            <p>It can also run in a daemon mode which is then controlled via a REST API.</p>
