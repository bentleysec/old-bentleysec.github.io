            <p>Medusa is an online password cracker</p>
            <p>Medusa is a speedy, parallel, and modular, login brute-forcer. The goal of medusa is to brute-force credentials in as many protocols as possible which eventually lead to remote code execution. It currently has over 21 modules, some of which are: CVS, FTP, HTTP, IMAP, MS-SQL, MySQL, NCP (NetWare), PcAnywhere, POP3, PostgreSQL, rexec, rlogin, rsh, SMB, SMTP (VRFY), SNMP, SSHv2, SVN, Telnet, VmAuthd, VNC and a generic wrapper module.</p>
