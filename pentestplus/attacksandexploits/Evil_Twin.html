            <p><b>Evil Twin</b> attacks are when an attacker sets up a fake access point for unsuspecting people to connect to, effectively creating a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>
              <h4>Karma Attack</h4>
              <p>KARMA Attacks Radio Machines Automatically (KARMA) attacks listen for probe requests in WiFi networks and respond as if they are the access point, connecting the client to the attackers access point and not the authentic access point.</p>
              <h4>Downgrade Attack</h4>
              <p>Downgrade attacks trick clients into using less secure protocols or encryption</p>
              <h4>Tools</h4>
              <p>Attackers can use the Aircrack-ng suite to create an evil twin:</p>
              <ol>
                  <li>Listen to traffic over the air to find the SSID and MAC of the legitimate access point.</li>
                  <li>Clone the legitimate access point using airbase-ng</li>
                  <li>Send de-auth packets to de-authenticate clients</li>
                  <li>Make sure that the face access point signal is stronger, which makes the clients connect to it automatically</li>
                  <li>Attacker performs man-in-the-middle attacks</li>
              </ol>
