            <p>Phishing is an attempt by an attacker to obtain sensitive information from the company such as: usernames, passwords, or credit card information. The attacker tries to trick the victim by posing as a trustworthy person. Phishing is carried out over electronic communications such as email, phone, IM, or text messaging. There are many types of phishing attacks: Spear Phishing, SMS Phishing (Smishing), Voice Phishing (Vishing), and Whaling.</p>
            <h4>Spear Phishing</h4>
            <p>Typically, phishing is carried out by sending as many messages to as many people as possible in the hopes that someone falls for the scam and takes the bite. <b>Spear Phishing</b> is when a phishing message is specially crafted for individuals and not for a broader group.</p>
            <h4>SMS Phishing</h4>
            <p>Phishing over SMS Messages.</p>
            <h4>Voice Phishing</h4>
            <p>Social engineering over the phone.</p>
            <h4>Whaling</h4>
            <p>Like Spear Phishing, only targeted at high level members of the organizations such as the CEO.</p>
