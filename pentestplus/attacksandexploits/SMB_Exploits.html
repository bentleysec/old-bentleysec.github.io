            <h5>SMB</h5>
            <p><b>Server Message Block (SMB)</b> is a network protocol that provides access to files, printers, and serial ports between hosts on a network. It also provides a mechanism for authenticating users to verify they have the necessary privileges for access.</p>
            <h5>Exploit</h5>
            <p>There have been many major vulnerabilities in the implementation of the protocol or components that it relies. Most of these vulnerabilities are caused by insecure authentication protocols like NTLMv1, LanMan, or plaintext credentials. SMB is one of the primary attack vectors for intrusion attempts.</p>
