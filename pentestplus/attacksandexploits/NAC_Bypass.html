            <p><b>Network Access Control</b> (NAC) authenticates hosts to the network. This is to block harmful devices from connecting to the local area network.</p>
            <p>NAC Bypassing is when an attacker finds an alternative method to connect to the network. A common technique is to change the MAC address to match an authentic host.</p>
