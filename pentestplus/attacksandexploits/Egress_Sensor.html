            <p>Egress sensors are often used in high traffic areas to automatically unlock doors so staff can exit easily. Attackers can trick these sensors to make them open. A common type of sensor is Passive Infrared or PIR. PIR detects motion by changes in temperature within it's field of view. By using a can of compressed air, upside down, it lowers the temperature and can trigger the sensor.</p>
