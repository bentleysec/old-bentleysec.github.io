            <p><b>WiFi Protected Setup (WPS)</b> is used in wireless networks for it's ease of use in connecting clients. It is far easier to connect a printer by the push of a button than entering a password. WPS uses an 8-digit PIN to authenticate clients, which can easily be brute-forced. An attacker can use a pixie dust attack to brute-force the PIN.</p>
