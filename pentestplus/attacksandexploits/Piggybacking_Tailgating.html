            <p>In a piggyback attack the attacker convinces an employee, or otherwise authorized individual, to allow them through the door.</p>
                <h4>Tailgating</h4>
                <p>In a tailgate attack the attacker follows and employee, or otherwise authorized individual, through the door. The difference between Piggybacking and Tailgating is consent. In a Piggyback attack you have the consent of the victim, in a Tailgate attack you do not have the consent.</p>
