            <p>Many companies use badges to identify employees. An attacker can find an employee badge by stealing, or even finding a picture of one on social media. If the company uses RFID in the badge to open doors, an attacker can buy a RFID cloner online and clone an employee badge. An RFID cloner only needs to be fairly close to work. </p>
