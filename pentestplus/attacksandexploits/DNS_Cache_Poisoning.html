            <p>DNS spoofing , also known as DNS cachepoisoning , can allow you to redirect traffic to a different host that you control. A poisoned DNS entry will point traffic to the wrong IP address, allowing attackers to redirect traffic to a system of their choice. Most DNS cache poisoning relies on vulnerabilities in DNS software, but improperly secured or configured DNS servers can allow attackers to present DNS information without proper validation.</p>
