   The Journey Begins: My Path to Becoming a Detection Engineering SME
</h2>        
</header>

<div class="entry__content">
<p>Every cybersecurity professional has that moment — a realization that this field is vast, fascinating, and constantly evolving. For me, that moment came while discussing frustrations with co-workers over our false positive rate, and thinking: "<i>There has to be a better way.</i>"</p>

<p>That thought sparked a deeper curiosity, and now, I’ve decided to <em>document my journey to becoming a Subject Matter Expert (SME)</em> in four key areas I believe are critical to the modern defender:
<ul>
    <li>SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)</li>
    <li>Logging and telemetry best practices</li>
    <li>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)</li>
    <li>Detection Engineering</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Why These Areas?</h3>

<p>Each of these disciplines plays a massive role in building effective threat detection and response capabilities:
<ul>
    <li><strong>SIEM</strong> gives us visibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Logging</strong> gives us context.</li>
    <li><strong>OSINT</strong> gives us insight.</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Engineering</strong> gives us power.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The more I learn, the more I realize that strong detections aren't just rules—they’re built from <strong>good data, strong hypotheses, and repeatable, testable engineering.</strong></p>

<h3>My Roadmap</h3>
<p>'ve created a structured roadmap to guide my progress. It spans from fundamentals (networking, log formats, MITRE ATT&CK) to more advanced skills like:
<ul>
    <li>Writing and testing Sigma rules</li>
    <li>Automating detection deployment via CI/CD</li>
    <li>Scaling SIEM pipelines</li>
    <li>Gathering and visualizing OSINT for enrichment</li>
    <li>Building a detection content repo with full lifecycle management</li>
</ul></p>

<p>I’ll be sharing resources, tools, labs, setbacks, breakthroughs, and personal reflections here on this blog.</p>

<h3>What to Expect</h3>
<p>My upcoming posts will include:
<ul>
    <li>Lab setups and walkthroughs (Elastic, Splunk, HELK, Wazuh, etc.)</li>
    <li>Deep dives into detection rule tuning and testing</li>
    <li>Lessons learned while building a detection-as-code pipeline</li>
    <li>OSINT workflows for defenders</li>
    <li>Threat hunting scenarios and MITRE ATT&CK coverage</li>
</ul></p>
