        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a critical component of modern cybersecurity and intelligence gathering. It involves the collection and analysis of publicly available information from a wide range of sources to glean valuable insights. In this technical blog post, we will explore what OSINT is, how to effectively conduct it, why it is crucial, the tools you can use, and ways to hone your OSINT skills for better results.</p>

        <h3>Section 1: Understanding OSINT</h3>
        <h5>What is OSINT?</h5>
        <p>OSINT, short for Open Source Intelligence, is the process of gathering information from publicly accessible sources, both online and offline. These sources include websites, social media platforms, public records, news articles, and more. OSINT aims to extract valuable data and insights for various purposes, including cybersecurity, threat intelligence, and investigations.</p>
