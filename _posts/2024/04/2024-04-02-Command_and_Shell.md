<p>As cyber defenders, we need to understand the techniques attackers use to compromise systems. One very common and powerful technique is abusing command and scripting interpreters. Let's break this down.</p>

<h4>What are Command and Scripting Interpreters?</h4>

<p>These are programs that allow you to execute instructions/commands on an operating system. Some examples:
<ul>
<li>Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe)</li>
<li>PowerShell (powershell.exe)</li>
<li>Bash shell on Linux/macOS</li>
<li>Python (python.exe)</li>
<li>Perl (perl.exe)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>While intended for legitimate tasks, hackers love these interpreters because of their versatility during attacks.</p>

<h4>How Attackers Abuse Them</h4>

<p>Interpreters provide functionality to perform all sorts of malicious actions like:
<ul>
<li>Running code to activate malware</li>
<li>Harvesting user credentials</li>
<li>Scanning/reconnaissance of networks</li>
<li>Lateral movement to other systems</li>
<li>Data destruction</li>
</ul></p>
<p>For example, an attacker may use cmd.exe or PowerShell to run utilities like net.exe to find other machines to attack. Or they may run scripts to download more hacking tools.</p>

<h4>Mitigating the Risks</h4>

<p>To limit attackers abusing interpreters:
<ul>
<li>Use whitelisting to only allow approved interpreters to run</li>
<li>Restrict permissions to only give authorized people/programs access</li>
<li>Configure PowerShell to prevent unsigned/malicious scripts</li>
<li>Use security tools to watch for anomalous interpreter behavior</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Detecting the Technique</h4>

<p>Signs an interpreter may be abused include:
<ul>
<li>Unexpected interpreters like cmd.exe running</li>
<li>Interpreters spawning other suspicious programs</li>
<li>Network connections initiated by interpreters</li>
<li>Interpreters being leveraged to run recon/scanning commands</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Logging tools like Sysmon can record interpreter execution. EDR solutions can detect and prevent malicious interpreter activity.</p>

<p>The flexibility of interpreters is why attackers rely on them so heavily. By understanding this technique, defenders can take steps to shut down this attack vector.</p>
