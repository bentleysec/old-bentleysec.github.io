<p>In today's ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, understanding the tactics and techniques employed by adversaries is crucial for effective defense. The MITRE ATT&CK framework has emerged as a comprehensive knowledge base, cataloging the various methods used by threat actors during cyber attacks.</p>

<p>This blog series will delve into the most prevalent techniques observed across various incidents and attack groups, shedding light on the modus operandi of cybercriminals. By gaining insights into these common tactics, security professionals can enhance their defensive posture and better prepare for potential threats.</p>

<p>The MITRE ATT&CK framework organizes adversary behavior into a matrix of tactics and techniques, covering the entire attack lifecycle, from initial access to exfiltration. While the framework encompasses a vast array of techniques, certain methods have gained notoriety due to their widespread adoption by attackers.</p>
