        <p>SQL injection is a type of cyber attack that involves injecting malicious code into an organization's database through a vulnerable input field, such as a login form or search box. This can allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the organization's data, potentially resulting in the loss or theft of sensitive information.</p>

        <p>One of the key characteristics of SQL injection attacks is that they exploit vulnerabilities in the way that the organization's database is designed and implemented. For example, if the database is not properly configured to handle user input, an attacker may be able to inject malicious code into a vulnerable input field, which the database will then interpret and execute as if it were a legitimate request.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of a simple SQL injection attack:
        <ul>

            <li>An attacker creates a malicious login form that is designed to mimic the organization's legitimate login form.</li>
            <li>When a user attempts to log in using the malicious form, the attacker-supplied username and password are passed to the organization's database as part of a SQL query.</li>
            <li>Because the database is not properly configured to handle user input, the attacker-supplied code is executed by the database, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the organization's data.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>SQL injection attacks can have serious consequences for organizations. In addition to the potential loss or theft of sensitive data, SQL injection attacks can disrupt business operations, resulting in financial losses and reputational damage.</p>

        <p>To protect against SQL injection attacks, organizations must ensure that their databases are properly designed and configured to handle user input. This may include implementing input validation and sanitization, using prepared statements to separate user input from SQL commands, and implementing other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the organization's databases.</p>

        <p>SQL injection is a serious threat to organizations, and it is important that they take appropriate measures to protect against these attacks and to minimize the impact of these attempts.</p>
